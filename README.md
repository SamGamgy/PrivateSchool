This repository is holding the code for a private school in Virginia; Montessori Lab School's website re-design of August 2022.

The original website was around 15 years old and was built with a template from a web services company.

We took this school's site into the modern age with this dynamic, modern, and functional website. 

Client wanted a clean design, featuring the key value propositions of the school, as well a space for their photos to be displayed. In addition, one of the main functions of the website is to act as a funnel for potential interested parents to find out more information, and start the enrollment process. 

The Design is personlized to help brand their school as the internationally focused and high quality cirriculum that they offer.
