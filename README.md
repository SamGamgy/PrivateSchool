This repository is holding the code for a private school in Virginia; Montessori Lab School's website re-design of August 2022.

The original website was around 15 years old and was built with a template from a web services company.

We took this school's site into the modern age with this dynamic, modern, and functional website. 

Client wanted a clean design, featuring the key value propositions of the school, as well a space for their photos to be displayed. In addition, one of the main functions of the website is to act as a funnel for potential interested parents to find out more information, and start the enrollment process.
